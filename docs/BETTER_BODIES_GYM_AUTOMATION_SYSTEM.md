# 1) ONE-PAGE SYSTEM SUMMARY

## What it does
This system gives Better Bodies Gym one operating spine for leads, tours, members, payments, attendance, and follow-up tasks. It runs on Google Forms + Google Sheets + Gmail + WhatsApp Business (manual send or semi-automated send). It reduces drift by making every lead visible, assigning next actions, and alerting early when numbers dip.

Core outcomes:
- No lead should be unlogged.
- First response target is under 2 minutes during business hours.
- Every tour is tracked as show / no-show / close / lost.
- Payment failures are flagged on Day 1, Day 3, Day 7.
- Attendance drift is flagged at 7 and 14 days.
- Owner gets a Monday pulse report and critical alerts.

## What it refuses to do
- It does not replace your billing provider or banking system.
- It does not promise full WhatsApp bot automation (system still works with manual WhatsApp send).
- It does not run custom software development.
- It does not hide bad data; it forces clean inputs and simple statuses.

## Who runs what (Front desk vs Owner vs Founder A/B)
- Front Desk
  - Logs walk-ins and inbound messages using Lead Intake Form.
  - Sends WhatsApp follow-ups from daily task list.
  - Updates tour outcomes and payment notes.
  - Completes attendance correction if scanner/manual log missed.
- Owner
  - Handles escalations (high-value lead, repeated no-show, payment risk).
  - Reviews daily exception list (overdue follow-ups, payment Day 7, 14-day no-attendance).
  - Reviews Monday pulse report and sets one weekly focus action.
- Founder A (Operations)
  - Maintains sheet formulas, automations, and role permissions.
  - Tunes thresholds monthly.
- Founder B (Growth/Sales)
  - Owns scripts, offer wording, and follow-up quality checks.
  - Runs weekly sales coaching based on conversion metrics.

## Daily rhythm (10–20 min blocks)
- 06:00 opening block (10 min)
  - Check new leads since last shift.
  - Send immediate responses for any unsent leads.
  - Confirm same-day tour bookings.
- 12:00 midday block (10 min)
  - Clear overdue follow-up tasks.
  - Mark show/no-show for morning tours.
- 17:00 evening block (15–20 min)
  - Send Day 1/3/7 follow-ups.
  - Resolve payment reminders due today.
  - Trigger owner escalation list.

## Weekly rhythm (Monday report)
- Monday 08:00–08:30
  - Auto-generated weekly report sent to owner by email.
  - Owner posts summary to management WhatsApp group.
  - Team picks top 2 fixes for the week (example: improve Day 0 response, reduce no-shows).

Exceptions

- After-hours inquiry: set `NextActionDate` to next opening time (06:00 next open day), send after-hours acknowledgement.

Stop rules
- Stop capture workflow when LeadStatus becomes `Booked Visit`, `Won`, or `Lost`.

# 5) TOOL STACK (2 OPTIONS)

## Option 1: Cheapest reliable build (Sheets + Forms + Email + manual WhatsApp)
Components
- Google Form: Lead Intake Form.
- Google Sheets: all 7 tables + dashboard tab.
- Gmail: alerts and Monday report.
- Google Apps Script: ID generation, trigger-based task creation, weekly report email.
- WhatsApp Business app: staff sends templates manually.

Why chosen
- Lowest cost.
- Works tomorrow with existing tools.
- Minimal failure points.

Setup complexity
- Low to medium (1–2 days).

What can break and detection
- Form disconnected from sheet → detect by test lead at opening each day.
- Apps Script trigger fails → detect via missing daily heartbeat email.
- Staff skips updates → detect via `Open Tasks > 1 day overdue` widget.

## Option 2: More automated (Airtable/CRM + Make/Zapier + official messaging if needed)
Components
- Airtable or HubSpot Free for lead/member pipeline.
- Make or Zapier for workflow automation.
- Gmail for fallback and reports.
- WhatsApp via official provider (if approved) or manual send fallback.

Why chosen
- Better audit trail, cleaner task boards, easier scaling to multiple gyms.
- More automation of reminders and escalations.

Setup complexity
- Medium (3–7 days).

What can break and detection
- Automation scenario paused/error → detect with daily error digest email.
- API/message provider outages → fallback to manual WhatsApp task queue.
- Data mismatch between tools → nightly reconciliation report (record counts by table).

# 7) OPERATING CHECKLISTS (NO THINKING REQUIRED)

## Front desk daily checklist
1. Open dashboard at shift start.
2. Process all `New Leads` older than 2 minutes.
3. Send due follow-ups (Day 1/3/7).
4. Confirm today’s bookings.
5. Mark tour outcomes immediately after each visit.
6. Log payments received today.
7. Clear open tasks before shift ends or handover with notes.

## Owner daily checklist
1. Review exception list (10 min):
   - Overdue lead replies
   - Payment Day 7
   - 14-day no-attendance
2. Handle escalations and approvals (waivers/freezes).
3. Verify one random lead journey per day for quality.

## Weekly checklist (Monday pulse review)
1. Read weekly pulse email.
2. Compare against thresholds.
3. Pick top 3 issues and assign owner + deadline.
4. Review conversion by source.
5. Review payment failure reasons and fix root cause.
6. Share summary with team.

## Monthly checklist (threshold tuning + cleanup)
1. Audit data quality (missing phone, stale statuses, duplicate leads).
2. Recalculate 4-week baselines.
3. Tune thresholds only if repeated false positives.
4. Archive closed/lost items older than 90 days.
5. Confirm access permissions and remove inactive staff.

## Kill list rule (when overwhelmed)
Cut in this order (never cut lead capture or payment reminders):
1. Pause Day 7 sales follow-up first.
2. Pause non-critical dashboard formatting updates.
3. Pause optional growth experiments.
4. Keep only: lead capture, Day 0/1 follow-up, booking handling, payment Day 1/3/7, 14-day churn alerts.
